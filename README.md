## This project is not currently functioning or deployed. It was built for Launch Hackathon, February, 2016.

## Inspiration
- 44% of Online customers say live Q&A is one of the most important features.
- 62% Say live-chat makes them more likely to purchase again.
- 38% Say they made their purchase BECAUSE of the chat session.

Live chat on eCommerce sites drives sales.
But...SMBs don't have dedicated support teams to handle 24/7 customer service.

EasyChat.Online gives Entrepreneurs the best of both worlds--Online chat to drive more sales, flexibility to be on-the-go.

## What it does
3 components: 
- Chat widget that is embedded on client website (1 line of Javascript) and shows the picture of the employee on duty
- Website where Employees can schedule shifts, view analytics, and change configuration options
- Mobile app that allows employees to field live chat when it is their shift

The application as a whole facilitates (up to) 24/7 live chat support for SMBs and allows them to distribute the responsibility to as many employees as they would like.

## How I built it
- Ruby on Rails Backend
- React Native app
- Javascript embeddable widget

## Challenges I ran into
Sinch NPM SDK is not compatible with current build of Mac OS...

## What's next for EasyChat.Online
Additional functionality to build in:
- firm up chat functionality and save carbon copies to server
- Add option to 'propose an audio call' with the client
- Adopt codebase to support multi-tenancy
